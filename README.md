## ✦ Engineering Philosophy

> **“Models are cheap. Systems are hard.”**

I work at the intersection of **Generative AI, system design, and MLOps**, focusing on building AI products that are:
- Reliable under production load  
- Observable, debuggable, and scalable  
- Aligned with real business workflows  

My goal is not just to build accurate models, but to engineer **robust AI systems** that deliver real-world impact.

## 🧠 Core Expertise

- **Agentic & Generative AI Systems**  
  RAG pipelines, tool-using agents, multimodal reasoning, structured LLM outputs, guardrails.

- **ML Engineering & MLOps**  
  End-to-end ML pipelines, experiment tracking, CI/CD for ML, monitoring & evaluation.

- **Backend & System Architecture**  
  AI-first backend design using FastAPI, async workflows, and cloud-native patterns.
